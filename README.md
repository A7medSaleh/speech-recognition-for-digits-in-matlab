This code analyzes user voice saying digits and train the computer to it so it can be identified later and determine the digits said by the user. This code can be a core for very exciting projects like turning speech to text or making a voice password that can't be hacked.

The code is implemented in four scripts two for creating the training set and another for creating input voice files. Another two for training the model which saves the trained model in Model.mat file and the final code takes in the voice input and recognize the digits said by user for testing the recognition system. The code works with high speed on MATLAB platform.
